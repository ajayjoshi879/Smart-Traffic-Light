Internet of things project: smart traffic light system

Goal: have the traffic light system function based on the sensed data and communicate with the neighboring systems. Currently, these systems follow some pre-defined cycle of actions.

Initial thoughts: platform and boards comparison resulted in the conclusion to use the Arduino Yun board. It combines the power of Linux with the ease of use of Arduino.
