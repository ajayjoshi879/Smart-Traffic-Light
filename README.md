# Smart Traffic Light System (IoT)

Goal: have the traffic light system function based on the sensed data. Currently, these systems follow some pre-defined cycle of actions.

Initial thoughts: platform and boards comparaison resulted in the conclusion to use the Arduino Uno board. It contains all the features needed to develop this project.

Future Work: Traffic Lights communicate with the neighboring systems for better prediction. Traffic light system also can communicate with cars to exchange traffic conditions and trajectories.

This project includes a report explaining the technicality behind the project, a product marketing presentation, a demo video explaining the flow of the project along with the hardware used, and finally the software developped.
